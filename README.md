# happyCanvas
Browser extension for firing confetti when submitting assignments on Canvas Instructure.

# What it does
Happy Canvas is a lightweight browser extension that helps you celebrate the submission of your assignments and quizzes on the Canvas Instructure LMS platform. After submitting any assignment or quiz on Canvas, you are rewarded with a pop of flying confetti.

# How we built it
Happy Canvas was built with lots of love in vanilla Javascript, as a Chrome-focused browser extension to Manifest v2 specifications. Confetti animations are provided by a module called canvas-confetti (unrelated to Canvas Instructure).

# What's next for Happy Canvas
Happy Canvas will be actively developed and maintained, as long as students ask for it. Currently, there is no variation in the celebratory confetti. The same animation will play each time, quickly becoming old and no longer serving to positively reinforce submissions. In future versions of Happy Canvas, we want to

[] mix and match colours from a harmonic palette, add rare 1-in-100 animations, and look to expand beyond just confetti flying on the screen. For example, we’d like to explore the redesign of the post-submission popup message, or play some sort of validating jingle (think: sound effect that plays when connecting your phone charger). Additionally, we’d like to implement options for the user to choose from, regarding audio, visual elements, and frequency of celebrations.
As Happy Canvas is supposed to be a shiny aftermarket addition to an otherwise boring LMS interface, the main objective is to avoid user burnout, and never let them feel that Happy Canvas is just another thing that happens in the background.
